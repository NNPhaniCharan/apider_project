Kiss & Spell (2017) - full transcript,"Spellbinding hilarity ensues when a magician, who is deathly afraid of ghosts, falls for a girl haunted by them in this surreal Vietnamese romcom from late writer/director Stephane Gauger, who tragically passed away during post-production. Tung is at the height of his career making audiences believe in ghosts, ironically his own phobia. He's smitten by a member of his staff, Phuong, who's quietly lonely and refuses to go out with the production team; instead of friends, she has dinner parties at home with a giant teddy bear while FaceTiming her mother and fitness-obsessed sister. After Tung and crew finally coax Phuong out for drinks, she drunkenly reveals that ghosts haunt her everyday life and everyone close to her, hence her hermit ways. Tung laughs her story off...until Phuong's ghosts start following him to scare him off from his romantic pursuits. In a quirky clash of fear and attraction, Tung and Phuong embark on a quest to free her from the ghosts of friendships past and their curse of loneliness. A remake of the Korean hit Spellbound, this jovial comedy-horror-romance delivers heart and laughter by the bellyful.","Ladies and gentlemen,,tonight, a very special performance,will be brought to you.,You will witness a top-notch magic show.,A year ago, I was still performing,on crowded streets.,It was just me and Phuc, my best friend.,Just simple tricks.,Enough to make a living.,But something was missing in my life.,Two, one, hey!,I haven't done anything.,Let's see!,Thank you!,

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (2013) - full transcript,"The events of Battle of Gods take place some years after the battle with Majin Buu, which determined the fate of the entire universe. Bills, the God of Destruction, is tasked with maintaining some sort of balance in the universe. After awakening from a long slumber, Bills is visited by Whis and learns that the galactic overlord Frieza has been defeated by a Super Saiyan from the North Quadrant of the universe named Goku, who is also a former student of the North Kai. Ecstatic over the new challenge, Goku ignores King Kai's advice and battles Bills, but he is easily overwhelmed and defeated. Bills leaves, but his eerie remark of ""Is there nobody on Earth more worthy to destroy?"" lingers on. Now it is up to the heroes to stop the God of Destruction before all is lost.","{\move(10,10,190,230,100,400)\fad(0,1000)\fscx25\fscy25\t(0,6000,\fscx125\fscy125)\c&H000000&\3c&H00FFFF&}anoXmous,Once upon a time,,in an obscure corner of the earth,,there was a teeny-tiny encounter.,And so began the long, long,adventure and days spent in combat,involving Son Goku and his friends,,and revolving around the Dragon Balls.,Battles against foes who,were mesmerized by Shen Long,,who would grant any wish...,Hit the mark!,A furious fight against Piccolo,,which ended in vengeance...,You lose!,The matchup against Vegeta,,with the survival of humanity at stake...,
,
,
,
,You dumb-ass!,The battle with Freeza on Planet Namek...,The Artificial Humans and the Cell Games...,See you in hell!,Now!,The final showdown with Majin Boo...,As one after another,powerful enemies appear,,the Super Saiyan Goku,,together with his growing sons,,Gohan and Goten, and his other friends,,save the earth from its tight spots,,and before anyone knows it,,peace returns to earth.,However...,Have you sensed it, too, Kaioshin?,Yes. He certainly is,awake early this time, isn't he?,My word, peace truly is short-lived.,
,
,
,
,And after they just created,the world anew, too.,I would think that Kaio,and the others sense it, too,,but tell him to be on the,lookout, just in case.,Mm-hmm. All right.,Yes, Kaioshin-sama.,Yes, yes...,Yes, I have noticed it, too.,Hey! Be quiet, Goku! I'm,trying to talk here!,Goku? Do you mean, Son Goku-san is there?,Y-Yes.,He is here on my world to train.,We cannot allow him to,become aware of this.,He is sure to take an interest.,Yes, of course, where,Beers-sama is concerned...,G-Goodbye, then...,What about Beers-sama?,G-Goku!,Huh? Is that the name of some candy?,Y-You found me out, huh?,It is a most delicious candy.,Well of course it ain't!,Kaio-sama, you were talking,like you were pretty freaked out.,It's something you don't,need to know about.,Oh, if you tell me that,,I'm just gonna ask you even more!,There's no way I'm telling.,You were speaking to Kaioshin-sama, right?,Maybe I'll go ask him directly.,All right! All right! Don't go,using your Instantaneous Movement!,Don't tell Kaioshin-sama,that you heard this from me.,There are deities in this,world that create planets and life,,such as Kaioshin-sama.,And, conversely,,there are also deities,who destroy planets and life.,So then,,this Beers-sama is one of them?,That is correct. Beers the Destroyer.,Huh? He's a deity, but,he's still a destroyer?,Birth and destruction.,They're needed in order to,maintain balance in the world.,I wonder how many worlds,will fall victim this time.,My goodness...,...Beers the Destroyer is awakening, is he?,We won't know peace for some time, huh?,Why have you changed into your gi?,This Beers-sama guy is,pretty strong, right?,Don't tell me you're...,I can't wait to see how strong he is!,Y-You idiot!,What?!,You just don't get it!,Beers-sama's strength,is on a completely different,level than you are!,He's Beers-sama, the,greatest destroyer in the world!,He's such a capricious,destroyer that even Kaioshin-sama,would be scared to come,face-to-face with him,,and maybe pee his pants,a little bit, he's so terrifying!,The part where he's the strongest,in the world has me fascinated!,Please wake up, Beers-sama.,You must not fall back asleep again.,You are the one who set your,alarm bomb yourself, aren't you?,If you don't get up soon,,your backup alarms will...,All right... all right.,I won't have you sleeping in,for 15 years, like you did last time.,If you insist on not getting up...,...would you like me to perform,my waking-up song for you again?,Well then...,A-All right!,All right.,I only slept 39 years this time.,That's no more than a catnap.,Beers-sama, you are the,one who set your wake-up time.,Incidentally, why did you choose this time?,There's something that I was curious about.,Well, I have prepared your bath.,Please go take it.,No way. I hate baths.,You are covered in bomb soot.,It could contain mold.,Come on!,What if I say no?,Someone will say ""Beers the Destroyer,is amazing, but pee-yew!"",and word will spread around.,Whis, I'm tired of your unfunny jokes.,I'll destroy you.,By the way, Whis, while I was asleep,,did Freeza leave Planet,Vegeta destroyed for me?,Yes, without a trace.,Oh, yeah? I could have given,the folks on that planet an eternity,,but they'd still be nothing but trouble.,And that King Vegeta was,especially hard-fisted.,I would have been happy,to destroy them, too,,but their world is so far away,,you know? It was too much trouble.,I have to admit, though,,Freeza is a bad apple, too.,He's so self-important.,The next time I see him,,I think I might destroy him, too.,There won't be any need for that.,Freeza has been defeated.,Eh?,You mean there's someone,that can defeat Freeza?,One moment, please.,Huh? It seems like I've,seen this somewhere before.,Who is this guy?,A Saiyan.,He appears to be called,both Son Goku and Kakarrot.,I thought all the Saiyans died in,the destruction of Planet Vegeta.,Most of them did perish,,but some who happened to,be on other worlds were spared.,And by the way, Prince,Vegeta was one of them.,Isn't Saiyan hair supposed to be black?,I have to say, I'm surprised,a Saiyan could defeat Freeza.,At this point, the Saiyans,have acquired a technique,whereby they become,what they call ""Super Saiyans."",What's that?,Super Saiyan? Super Saiyan?,Super Saiyan?!,That's it.,That's what it was!,What what was?,Let's see... Super Saiyan...,Super Saiyan...,n-God!,I dreamed about it!,A dream where I fought against,a Super Saiyan God, like this guy!,Uh-huh.,You still don't get it?,It was a premonition. Premonition!,You mean, your dream?,Beers-sama, your premonitions,don't have all that high,an accuracy rate, do they?,That dream you had earlier,about that idol moving here,didn't come true, did it?,You're making fun of me, huh?,All right, come with me, Whis.,Seer! Seer, are you here?,I was taking a walk. What is it?,You told me 39 years ago, didn't you,,that in 39 years, an,arch-rival would appear?,Did I say that?,You said so, didn't you?,Okay, I did.,See?,The Seer's prophecy and my premonition...,An arch-rival of mine is going to appear.,A Super Saiyan God!,It sounds entirely questionable to me.,It's hard to imagine an arch-rival,for you to begin with, Beers-sama.,Well, even if the arch-rival that the,Seer mentioned is an exaggeration,,someone fascinating is,bound to appear, right?,That's why I woke up early this time.,I see. So that's why.,So, are you going to go see the Saiyans?,Of course I am.,I have to find this ""Super Saiyan God."",Super Saiyan God, you say?,Such over-the-top naming.,It ends up sounding tawdry.,I found them. Most of,the surviving Saiyans,,five of them, are in 4032 Green, on Planet,877, living on a world called ""earth."",Earth? I'm sure I've been,to that planet once, long ago.,That's the planet which,had something called dinosaurs,,which took a rude attitude toward me,,so I exterminated them, right?,However, one of them,,the Saiyan that defeated Freeza,,currently appears to be,on Kaio of the North's world.,A Saiyan at a Kaio's place?,That sounds suspicious.,Whis, how long will it take to get there?,Roughly 26 minutes.,About the length of an,episode of TV anime, huh?,Sure is far!,Well, what choice is there?,I'll suck it up and go.,All right, then, let's be off!,To the Kaio of the North's world!,Yeah!,Bulma-san, happy...,...birthday!,Eh?! He's not coming?!,Why is he training at,Kaio-sama's place at a time like this?,That's the kind of guy he is.,Geez, I told him about,this over six months ago!,Huh? Where's Vegeta-san?,Looks like he's training.,Honest to goodness, you Saiyans...,He)', you there!,Eh?,Don't just sit around,,bring me another drink.,I'll give you an autograph afterward.,All right, what kind of,drink would you like?,Mister Satan, this gentleman,is Bulma-san's father, Dr. Briefs.,Th-The greatest genius in the world?,Not to mention the richest,man in the world.,Oh, sweetheart, you're,the richest man in the world?,Huh, I'm not too sure of that, myself.,H-How terribly rude of me!,By the way, what kind of,drink would you like?,D-Don't be absurd!,I will bring you something to drink!,What can I get for you?,Huh? I'm fine right now.,Oh, not at all! What,would you like to drink?,Okay, a cola.,A cola! Right, as you wish!,I will bring you a whole case, right now!,Ah, geez, Papa. How embarrassing.,I put it on to look dashin' comin',to Bulma-san's birthday party.,By the way, Bulma-san, just how,old have you turned this birthday?,How rude! As though I'd tell you!,It's true that the prizes,for the bingo tournament,include a castle and an airplane, right?,That's right. If that's too much,trouble, I can convert it to cash.,That's the richest person,in the world for you!,I wonder if Goku-sa will drop in,for at least the bingo tournament.,Bulma, are there any,X-rated DVDs among the prizes?,No!,O-Oh, no!,Wh-What is it, Goku?!,Today is Bulma's birthday party!,This ain't good! She'll be mad at me!,Oh. Don't startle me over,something like that!,She's scary. Probably...,It would be a close contest,between her and this Destroyer guy.,Kaio-sama?,Goku!,Th-This is serious! Here! Right here!,Huh?! Bulma is coming here?!,No!,Beers-sama is!,Beers the Destroyer is on his way here!,Huh? Eh?,I ain't sensing anything.,You can't sense the presence of deities!,Remember, whatever you do,,refrain from doing anything stupid.,It will be fine, I tell you.,All right!,You worry me.,Goku, go hide inside the house!,Huh? What for?,Quickly!,And quickly, too. Geez...,Hurry!,Okay, O kaY!,Why, though? Why is Beers-sama coming here?,Why, indeed?,Wh-Why, Beers-sama...,Him, huh?,He sure looks like he,ain't just anyone, all right?,...w-welcome to my...,...humble place. Thank you,for coming... all this way...,Long time no see, huh?,Kaio of the North...,Huh? Oh! That guy's the,one they call Beers-sama?,I must say... your world...,...is small, huh?,Eh? Y-Yes... I'm terribly sorry.,Please excuse the cramped fit.,Long ago, Beers-sama,destroyed it, making it smaller...,taking it out after,losing at hide-and-seek.,Oh, did I?,However, considering that,you restored your world earlier,,and you did not bring,it back to its original size,,you must prefer it to be,this size, don't you?,Anyhow...,Beers-sama, what brings you here?,Ah, I have a little business,with the Saiyan inside.,Yikes!,Come on out here!,H-How terribly impolite of me!,Goku! Come say hello to Beers-sama!,Heya! I'm Go...,I was certain you were going to say that!,You're old enough to know better!,At least offer a proper greeting!,Uh, wh-why, hello there. I'm... I mean...,My name is Son Goku.,It's honorable to meet you, Sir.,Good morning. Now then,,I have something I want to ask you.,Let's see... Super...,Super Saiyan God.,Yes, yes.,Do you know of the existence,of this ""Super Saiyan God""?,Super Saiyan God?,I know of just plain ""Super Saiyans,"",but I ain't ever heard,of that ""God"" business.,I haven't heard of it, Sir.,This is the first time I have heard,the term ""Super Saiyan God,"" myself.,Ah, I see.,I heard from Whis, here, that,you're the one who defeated Freeza?,Freeza? Yeah, I defeated,him, all right. Sir.,It doesn't appear to me like,you could defeat him as you are,,but I understand you,transform and power up...,into what's called a Super Saiyan.,That is correct. You are well informed.,But you don't know about the God thing.,Whis...,...is Prince Vegeta, on the planet,called earth, also a Super Saiyan?,Yes. And each of the three others,also seem to be able to transform.,You know that much, as well?,All of them, huh?,That seems suspicious. Well then...,I wonder if I can find,anything by going to earth.,B-Beers-sama, I do not think,the other Saiyans know, either.,I won't know unless I ask them, will I?,Whis, how long to reach earth?,Roughly three minutes.,Three minutes? All right, then. Well, I,think I'm going to go see this ""earth."",Um...,You're not going to destroy it,,or anything, right?,As long as nothing happens to annoy me.,Hey, listen!,Ain't you... I mean, Beers-sama,,I heard you were ridiculously strong.,Would you mind showing,me just a little of it? Sir?,You want to see my power? How?,I'd like to have a sparring,match with you, if only for a minute!,Goku! That's enough!,I have lived a long time,,but I've never heard a,request as unique as that one.,You certainly seem sure of yourself.,Or could it be that you're simply,just a big dummy, instead?,Yes, he's a big dummy!,He is just a big dummy, you see!,Sure.,Okay, come at me with your full power.,Thank you! I mean, thank you very much!,But are you sure you want my,full power right from the start?,If you get hurt, don't go getting,upset and destroying this planet.,You have my promise.,Well, go ahead.,Okay -,First, this is ""Super Saiyan."",And this is ""Super Saiyan 2."",And this is the mighty ""Super Saiyan 3""!,Run for it, Bubbles!,Well, well, this is a surprise.,It appears that this isn't,just a bunch of hot air, after all.,Heh-heh, you see?,If you want, I can go back to ""2"" for you.,No, no, as you are will be fine.,Okay, begin.,You're looking down on me. All right...!,Well then, let's be off.,Okay -,See you later, Kaio of the North.,Are you still alive, you big dummy?,Oh, right! I can't just sit around.,I have to contact Vegeta,as soon as possible!,Vegeta! It's Kaio!,What do you want with me, Kaio?,Listen closely to what I'm about to say.,Beers the Destroyer will,be there very soon.,The Destroyer?,I've heard that name before.,In any case, once Beers-sama arrives there,,do absolutely, absolutely,nothing to engage him!,Otherwise, it will mean the,annihilation of the earth itself.,The earth will be annihilated?,Goku couldn't leave well,enough alone, and was easily beaten.,He was what?! Kakarrot?!,Super Saiyan 3 Goku was left,barely breathing after just two blows.,Just two blows, you say?,I'm begging you.,The fate of the earth rests with you.,That really was awesome.,Imagine, there being someone like that...,I warned you, over and over!,Just be grateful you weren't killed!,To get any stronger,,there ain't no choice but to,merge with Vegeta, is there? No...,...even at that, I doubt I could beat him.,Let's hope the people on,earth don't do anything foolish.,He said something about,""Super Saiyan God,"" didn't he?,Is that something I can,arrive at with training?,Or is it the name of a Saiyan,called ""God""? Is there another...?,A senzu bean?,I'm better!,Kaio-sama, we have to,let everyone on earth know!,I've already told Vegeta.,He's the one most likely,to step over the line, after all.,Things ain't looking good.,I'd better get back to earth right away.,Or maybe I should train a bit first.,You're finally here, huh, Vegeta?,Oh, and why are you,wearing your combat gear,to your own wife's birthday party?,What's wrong? You seem unusually blue.,A-ha, could it be that you're in shock over,your beloved wife turning another year older?,It sure is nice for you Saiyans,,not having to grow older.,Silence!,What do you mean, ""silence""?! Hmph!,What is this? I've got,a knot in my stomach.,Is the great Vegeta-sama,trembling with fear?,What is with you?,Beers the Destroyer...,Without a doubt, I know,I've met him somewhere before...,Hey, Prince Vegeta, right?,You're all grown up now, aren't you?,It looks like this ""Ki"" that you,all use doesn't work on deities.,Ah, yes, well...,Something's come over Vegeta.,Do you remember me now?,I remember!,When we previously met,,you were still just a little boy, huh?,Don't you remember? Your,father, King Vegeta,,put on quite a spread for me.,The Destroyer, Beers...,...-sama...,What Kaio said was no exaggeration.,This guy is trouble.,He's way beyond trouble!,It looks to me like you're up,to something enjoyable here.,What's more, I smell something very good.,A-Ah, this?

Hey, I get it!,I know why you're the,one he picked, Oolong!,He thinks that you're just an ordinary pig!,And as a pig, he thinks,you can only throw scissors!,However, you're a pig-man!,He doesn't realize you can,also throw rock and paper!,He's sure to throw rock,,so Oolong, if you throw paper, you'll win!,L-I get it! A-All right! L-Let's do this!,Are you ready yet?,Y-Yeah!,All right...,...Rock-paper-scissors!,...Rock-paper-scissors!,Fools! I heard your whole strategy.,Wait!,Goku!,Goku-sa!,Goku!,Son-kun'.!,You, again?

Ah, B-Beers-sama?!,Why, it is Beers-sama! Pleased to meet you!,Tell them how to form a Super Saiyan God.,Er, right!,I've never seen Shen Long like this.,A Super Saiyan God is a savior,,created by chance by a,handful of righteous Saiyans,,who long ago questioned the,evil acts of their fellow Saiyans,,and led a revolt against them.,This savior had immense power,,and dispatched the evil,Saiyans in no time at all,,but shortly thereafter,,they returned to normal,,with their power apparently used up.,Once again, Planet Vegeta,became a world of evil Saiyans,,and the savior was also,eliminated from their legends.,This vanished legend goes...,This story sure is long, huh?,Are you getting this, Vegeta?,Shh! Keep quiet!,...""Five Saiyans who possess,righteous hearts join hands,,and by instilling light into,another righteous Saiyan,,they will become a Saiyan god."",I have now told you the method. Farewell.,Please excuse me.,Five Saiyans who possess righteous hearts?,Hmph, that's impossible.,The only two Saiyans like,that are Gohan and Goten.,How rude of you! While we may,not be able to say much about Vegeta,,Trunks has a righteous heart, doesn't he?,Ha! Any kid his age that,already has a girlfriend is impure.,My, you sound like an old fogey!,Are you sure you're not just jealous?,Yeah, Piccolo-san! Are you,sayin' Goku-sa is impure, too?,Hmm, it's true that Goku may be pure,,but he's purely a fool for fighting.,Whether that counts as a,pure heart is a subtle distinction.,Shut your mouth, you dirty old geezer!,Wh-What did you call me?!,Such a thing to call a sage!,Hurry up and give rise,to a Super Saiyan God!,Um, broadly speaking,,don't all five of the Saiyans here,possess hearts that are righteous?,Hmm? Even Vegeta?,Don't you judge me!,Vegeta-san may have been,evil a long time ago,,but I'm not so sure about now. Is he evil?,Now that you mention it, you're right.,He hasn't done anything,bad for a good while now.,Stop insulting me!,You're saying the great,Vegeta-sama has a righteous heart?!,It doesn't matter,,just hurry up and give it a try!,Why does Kakarrot get to be the main one?,Quit complaining!,Father, h-has there been any change?,W-Well, I ain't sure.,There, thanks for waiting.,These are called tempura prawns, are they?,That's good, too.,Oh, they did m.,Well, Kakarrot?,Father, you have an,outstanding battle power.,Goku has finally gone and become a god!,Son-kun! Go ahead and show him!,Don't bother, Goku!,It won't do any good to fight him.,That was not godly.,B-But...,The reason your battle power went up,is due to nothing more than,collecting energy from the others.,He's correct in saying so.,If all you have is battle power,that appears superficially,,you can't call it godly.,Ah, that makes sense.,Yeah, you're right. I don't feel,like I could beat you, Beers-sama.,Oh, no...,Listen closely, everyone.,Please remember what he said.,The light from five of you,is instilled into one other.,The total number of Saiyans,you need is six, is it not?,Oh, so that's it! We goofed up!,Six? Then, one other... one other...,That's it!,Vegeta, you've got an on-the-level,younger brother, don't you?,On a faraway planet. What's worse,,I don't even know where it is.,You didn't even get his cell phone number?,Enough! I was looking forward,to an interesting development,,but you've disappointed me.,I'm starting to get drowsy,,so I'll destroy the earth,right now, and head home.,E-Excuse me! There is one other!,Videl-san? What other one?,Um, not quite another one,,but soon to be another one, you might say.,But it definitely has Saiyan blood.,What are you talking about, Videl?,Your papa may be a great man,,but I'm a full-blooded earthling!,I'm not talking about you, Papa!,Um, Videl-san has a baby inside her tummy.,D-Do you mean it?!,I do.,I didn't say anything, because,I wanted to surprise you, Gohan-kun.,Hooray!,...Wow!,...Congratulations!,Are you turning God, or not?,C-Come on, let's add,Videl-san, and try it again!,Mm-hmm!,Will this even work?,It hasn't even been born yet.,We've got nothing to,lose, so let's just try it!,Right.,Maybe it's not going to work after all...,Hey, that's the same,old Goku as always, right?,But look at him. His hair is red!,You're right. He also looks a bit thinner.,I can't tell what Goku's battle power is.,Congratulations.,It appears they were successful.,It was worth waiting so very patiently.,Really? Have I become a Super Saiyan God?,We should know once we start fighting.,Now, come and fight me.,All right! Well, here I come!,Sure. If you're the stronger one,,I won't destroy the earth for you.,Huh? You mean it? Thanks so much!,Okay, everyone, this will be dangerous,,so please give them a little more room.,Well? What are your,impressions on being a god?,I'm stunned.,I see. You're surprised.,That's the same impression I had.,Good. Keep that up.,What's wrong? You seem dissatisfied.,A little.,You don't care to be a god?,Nope. I never knew there,was a world like this.,What do you mean?,A world that I couldn't come to by myself.,And you're unhappy with that?,Yeah. I ain't happy!,Hmm? What's that?,An earthquake?,You say such interesting things.,You don't like working with,your friends to become a god?!,Oh, I'm happy. I'm happy,,but without using everyone else's power,,I couldn't fight with,you like this, Beers-sama!,That frustrates me!,Then why did you turn God?,Because I wanted to fight you, Beers-sama.,You really are a fool for fighting, huh?,I get that a lot.,Let's follow them!,Right!,Here we go!,They're ramping it up!,Excuse me.,I beg your pardon.,What is this mysterious, delicious item?,Huh? Oh, it's ice cream.,Ice cream? How novel!,Imagine, making food this cold!,Exactly how does one make it?,L-I don't know.,Oh, my. A reply as cold as this ice cream.,Well? That was a pretty,good one, wasn't it?,It looks like they're having,a pretty wicked fight, huh?,Th-That bastard! He always snaps up,the best of things for himself!,But still...,Wh-What?,I'm glad that's not me.,Huh?,Are you still unhappy with being a god?,A bit!,That pride will prove to be a weakness!,Good-for-nothing pride!,It's rare that a Saiyan,would be so hung up on it.,Wh-What power!,That ain't true. Vegeta has,far more pride than even I do.,Hmph, now that you mention it,,he forsook his pride earlier,,to protect the others.,I know. He forsook even,his pride as the prince.,Ain't that amazing?,I kind of respect him for that.,And that's why you also forsook,your pride to turn God, right?,That's right.,I wonder what those two are talking about.,It's almost as though,Goku were receiving training.,I should also say that there's,something I'm dissatisfied with.,Huh? What's that?,I still haven't even come,close to fighting all-out.,Oh, really? I was going at,about 80 percent of all-out.,Huh? 80 percent?,Then let's see if you can,keep up with this speed!,What's the matter?,Do you mean business yet?,Yeah! I mean business!,What's this? Using blasts now?!,Ha! This isn't some sporting event!,Stop enjoying destroying things!,He's not God!,He's reverted to a mere Super Saiyan!,C-Can you see them, Kuririn?,No, I can't.,If you're gonna start,using blasts against me...,...then I...,...have one for you!,Go ahead. Feel free.,Hal!,That's Goku's Kamehame-Ha!,Hmm? What's that?,I'll return the favor!,I'll take it, just like this!,Wh-What is that?,Beers' attack! Th-This is bad!,Damn it...!,Apparently, you haven't,realized it, yourself.,Wh-What?,Your Super Saiyan God,time ran out a good while ago.,R-Really?,B-But...,It seems as though while you,had turned God and were fighting me,,you absorbed that world into your body.,Which is why, even though,you've returned to normal,,you haven't powered down all,that much. You're something else.,I might even say you're one,of those rarely-seen prodigies.,If that's true, then I'm glad...,Then openly recognize that joy.,That's what you wanted, isn't it?,I can't do that. The first,matter at hand right now...,...is still how huge the,difference in our powers is!,Then give up and bow out!,What is going on?,Damn it...!,Goku-sa!,...Goku! ...Kakarrot! ...Father!,Hey, what did you just do?,L-I don't know.,You don't know?,You are a fascinating one.,What? Why did you stop?,I wanted to get you to say ""I give up."",I give up. I give ""P!,Beers-same, you sure are strong.,There ain't no way I could stand up to you.,You're the strongest,in the universe, all right.,It looks like you finally realize,the terror of Beers the Destroyer.,However, you are definitely,strong, yourself.,In the long, long history,of fights I've been through,,you are the second-strongest.,Huh? Wh-What, only second place?,All right, let me tell,you one last thing...,What? That you've,decided not to destroy earth?,No, I can't do that.,I make it a rule not to,change my mind once it's made up.,Then, wh-what...?,My attendant, a man named,Whis, is over there, right?,Huh? Y-Yeah...,While he may be my,attendant, he is also my teacher.,Eh? T-Teacher?! Then, the,strongest one in the universe is...,This world is the ""7th Universe."",I am the Destroyer for the 7th Universe.,There are 12 universes in all, you see.,Don't you expect that there are,even more fantastic guys out there?,Goku-sa!,...Goku!,...Son-kun!,L-I'm all right. I'm still alive.,Well then, as promised,,I will now destroy earth.,Oh my, Beers-sama, you destroyed,just a small piece of earth, huh?,Hmph, that's too bad. I guess,I don't have enough strength left.,I'll have to destroy it,completely some other time.,Beers-sama...,You there, when Beers-sama passes away,,would you be the next Destroyer?,Hey!,I'm afraid not.,That's too bad.,Mrs. Vegeta...,Huh? Me? Wh-What?,I'm sorry for all the commotion.,Never mind that, apologize for hitting me!,S-Sorry.,Hey, what are you, dim?!,If you don't mind, please,invite us to your next party.,If you promise not to act up.,Agreed. And this time, I'm going,to have some of that pudding.,I'll have the whole pool,filled and ready for you.,However, don't go telling me,you don't like it after you eat it.,If I don't like it, I really will,destroy the earth this time.,Then we'll get to fight,again, right, Beers-sama?,Farewell.,Unbelievable.,Absolutely right.,Beers the Destroyer did not destroy them.,Could it be because of the,marvelous character of Son Goku?,He keeps making more and more friends...,...until now, at last, even Beers-sama...,No,,we can't say it was,entirely because of Son Goku.,It's that whole group...,no, it may even be because,of the whole earth.,Son Goku, who was supposed,to have been a savage Saiyan,,to say nothing of Vegeta,,changed after coming to earth.,Humankind aside, it really,is a wonderful planet, isn't it?,Those people have all sorts of problems,,but they are brimming,with a wondrous charm.,I guess that was kind of fun.,I have to admit, his latent,ability is something unfathomable.,Although, I wouldn't,call him an arch-rival.,Even so, it's been a long,time since I've seen you,have to use nearly 70 percent,of your power, Beers-sama.,What was his name again?,Son Goku.,Between him and Vegeta,,they really might become my,arch-rivals before too long, huh?,You seem pleased by that.,As are you, aren't you, Whis?,It can become dull when,we both live so long.,Besides which, I do not sleep.,Well, I'm a bit tired,,so I think I'll take a three-year nap.,Three years? That is a,fairly brief snooze, isn't it?,There appear to be many more,delicious things on earth, after all.,Sure enough, you did not,feel like destroying earth,after finding how delicious the food is.,Oh, I don't know about that.,Ah, come to think of it...,I had them pack us something,absolutely delicious, called sushi,,for us to bring back with us.,Beers-sama, would you like some?,Or would you rather sleep?,Ha! I'll have some, of course!,It looks like you sampled,quite a bit of tasty food,while I was off fighting, huh, Whis?,Oh, this is some beautiful food, isn't it?,You apply a little of this fluid,,called soy sauce, and eat it.,What is this little green lump here?,That? Ah, now that you mention it,,the chef said ""Use it as you like,"",and that it was called ""wasabi."",Ah, come to think of it,,I did hear you talking about that.,While I was fighting.,Let me go get us something to drink.,Let's see, here...,That won't do!,Yow-w-w... That was mean of you.,Beers-sama, you do take out your,temper on innocent worlds, after all.,Hmph. This is all earth's fault.,All right, let's head back to,earth right now, and destroy it!,My word, after I said ""Use it as you like,"",you are the one who gulped,it down, right, Beers-sama?,Well then, let's make it,""if I don't like the taste of sushi,,it means destruction!"" instead.,Now then, please wake me,in another three years.,It was good, wasn't it?,Okay, good night.,Ah, Beers-sama, be sure to,brush before you go to sleep.,Huh? Yeah... all right, all right...,Okay, one more time, then!,Bulma-san, happy...,...birthday!,Yeah! 38 years old!,Shut up!,Let's drink!,When you're backed into a corner,,you may be more fearsome than anything.,Hey, Kakarrot, next time,,I'm the one who gets to turn God!,You be sure to cooperate with me.,Yeah, of course! But when you,overexert yourself to get stronger,,it leaves you all worn out afterward!,Oh, come to think of it, Vegeta,,when Bulma got hit, you were all,,""My Bulma!"", got angry, and turned,into an awesome Super Saiyan, huh?,I felt so loved!,L-I don't remember saying that!,J-Just that, at the time,,I definitely think I surpassed you!,Yeah, you sure did.,Next time, when we fight,someone who gives us trouble,,have him slap Bulma for us.,Hey!,I thought you weren't here,when Vegeta went off like that.,You arrived long before that,,using your Instantaneous Movement,,to see how things played out, didn't you?,Uh, well...,Son-kun'.!,Is that true, you jerk?!,While everyone else was getting beat up?!,Sorry!

The Fear Footage 2: Curse of the Tape (2020) - full transcript,"On 19 April, 2019, a police deputy's body camera footage from the night he disappeared was leaked. In the footage, he watched a mysterious VHS tape entitled, The Fear Footage. On September 22nd, a camera was found with footage of 2 missing men who were searching for that same tape. This is that footage.","[Music],vatsburg pennsylvania,and i moved into this apartment about,three weeks ago and for the past week,and a half i've been,hearing strange sounds coming from these,wooded areas out back in my apartment,building in the middle of the night why,would anyone or anything,be out here at three and four in the,morning making sounds,
,
,
,
,i mean there's nothing out here except,just acres and acres of woods,that isn't me,he looks just like me he,says he has a daughter named sarah he,says his name's daniel blanche that's my,name,but i never filmed that,that isn't me friend of mine bought that,never told him that i was in this movie,and it's because i'm not in the movie,i guess that's where he bought it from,and this whole thing is just impossible,um the tape that i'm on was captured,
,
,
,
,through a missing police officer's body,camera footage so i'm trying to see if i,can find like a company that was behind,releasing his body camera footage but,there's nothing on here,i've been looking into this all day,i haven't found much,i mean even,the details and,to the missing deputy are vague,i don't know if i should be scared,i don't know what this is,the more i think about it the,more i realize how crazy this whole,thing is,like i'm on,footage that i never filmed,it's me,there's other people on that tape,like myself that,probably don't even know they're on it,so,it's one in the morning right now i'm,gonna get some sleep and then,tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can figure,out who these other people are and,see if they know anything about this,i did a reverse image search of the,other people that were on that footage,and i only got one hit and it was this,guy,uh his name's james darvin,he looks exactly like one of the guys,that was on that tape he's got some,contact information on his social media,page so,i'm gonna reach out to him and,see what he knows about this,hello,hello,uh is this james,yes who is this,um,do you know,a person named jay or alex,you do,yeah okay um my name is daniel blanche,we don't know each other there's this,footage that i came in contact with and,i think it has you,and your friend alex and a guy named jay,were you guys ever in a,a movie did you ever star in a horror,movie,it's better if i just show you i'm,willing to come to you i'll i'll meet,you and just show you this footage,would you be okay with that i'll give,you my email address and you can contact,me first so you know i'm not,i know this is kind of a weird situation,this footage is weird it's real i'm on,it and i didn't know i was on it,i think you might be on it and you're,unaware of it as well,so i've been emailing back and forth,with james for four days i sent him some,stills of the footage,and he just sent this email over it says,yeah it's definitely strange i guess we,could meet at gaspin park near my house,if you want to show me the full video,seems like a long drive just to show me,a video but that's up to you i'm not,sure about going to maryland with you to,look into this i don't exactly know you,and this is all very confusing it could,just be a prank or some sort of mix up,i'll send over the address if you,definitely want to meet up let me know,thanks i'm gonna go meet him tomorrow um,he's about three hours from me he agrees,that's him on the footage i'm gonna show,him the entire footage and see if,he's interested in heading down the dark,bluff maryland that's where deputy leo,cole's body camera was found,and see if he wants to head down there,and look into this,so it's 3 15.,james said he will meet me here at three,i hope he's still coming i hope i didn't,come all this way for nothing,james hey what's up thanks for coming,man nice to meet you man this is alex,alex yeah i recognize him from the,footage,oh yeah sorry i hope you guys don't mind,i'm just kind of documenting this whole,thing when we talked to my phone you,didn't say nothing about a camera though,thank you guys for coming to meet me to,look into this yeah james did you show,him any of the stills from the footage i,said i briefly talked to him about some,of the stuff i haven't showed him,anything yet what about the other guy in,the video with youtube jay his name was,i don't even have any friends named jay,i never met the dude my life,ladies what's up dude let's go what's up,man fire that laptop up,there's no doubt about it,hey alex,just like carter,his name's alex,the other guy's name's james he looks,just like you,this could be one of the biggest we,chase i hope so man i mean you can't,deny it,in 2015 there was a young girl named,megan who killed herself and her family,in their house at 11 628 hangman road in,dark bluff maryland,and the house was demolished shortly,after,and then a year later the anniversary of,that incident,residents on hangman road were calling,into the dark bluff pd claiming that,the house that was demolished,mysteriously reappeared,so there's this deputy named leo cole,who,was sent to look into this,where the [ __ ] are you getting all this,information just listen just listen i i,know it sounds crazy so this deputy,shows up at this house that it's not,supposed to exist anymore,he goes in he finds this diary,about this little girl and she found,this weird videotape in her bedroom she,watched it,and watching that tape is what caused,her to kill her family,and that tape that she watched is the,footage that we're all on,i know this doesn't make any sense,deputy that went to look into the house,that reappeared is missing now and the,footage that you just saw is shot from,his body camera if this is about a cop,wouldn't this be all over the news we,would have heard about this i agree,apparently that footage was like,released by some ex-police officer at,the same,department he worked at what are they,just trying to bury this it's some it,seems like it's a cover-up i i don't,know cover up a what how do we know you,didn't make that move how you know i,didn't make it because you're both on it,how could i have footage of both of you,seriously i mean you you come in with,this movie then you're sticking this,camera in our [ __ ] face and [ __ ] like,what i don't know man,let's go man,this must be some type of scam or,something else do you explain what's on,the table,who would i want to scam you i don't,even know you alex come on man alex,james come on man this dude clearly,wants some money or something,i don't know i don't want anything you,explain what's on the tape man i don't i,don't understand what could i learn from,this,i don't know you guys what do i gain,look man just give me a minute to talk,to him i'll see if i can come on james i,just just give him i'm sorry but he's,got a point man i mean you're coming,approaching us with this [ __ ] talking,about cover-ups and i mean it's just oh,this whole situation's weird it's weird,but you i mean you admit that you in,there that's me on there,i just want to go look into this i feel,like i mean i get yeah it's me it's him,on there but with technology nowadays,man i don't know what to believe i don't,feel comfortable doing this without him,i mean,i don't know you man i don't know you i,don't know him none of us know each,other,we're all tied by this tape,well man all i can tell you is good luck,but,all right thanks for coming out here man,i'm i'm not a part of this [ __ ] i'm,sorry,i said good luck man,so it's been two days,since i met with james and alex,and,i've decided,i'm gonna go look into this,uh it's too strange um,it's too impossible,and considering what the footage depicts,it's actually kind of scary,so i printed out a map of dark bluff i,pack in my bag i took off work and,tomorrow i'm gonna head down,and look into this and see what,everything means,hello,james,what's up man,i know man me too,i was gonna head down there tomorrow,i'm just gonna try to look into this i,don't know what i'm gonna find,you should man,i mean i would rather not go alone,i'm gonna book a hotel tonight,probably like two or three days,tell me about it i probably watched it a,hundred times,i mean,literally this is the craziest thing,that's ever happened to me in my life,come on me man let's figure this out,yeah but you know if you don't you,you're always going to wonder about this,i mean i know i would,seriously,all right let's do it man,i'll text you my address and,you can meet me here in the morning what,time works for you like eight,okay,well what about alex you think he'll,come,all right well it's me and you man,all right i'll see you in the morning,all right bye,james yeah,all right i'm coming man,it's good to see my gate locking device,works yeah nice secure,filming,yeah i mean i want to document this,whole journey man is that all right with,you

up good to see you again man,thank you can you get anything you want,out of the fridge all right thanks i,gotta put a few more things in my bag,i'll be right back i'm actually good,though i already i had a coffee and like,a small sandwich before came out ma'am,i'm all right,how crazy is this whole thing man,um,it's pretty crazy man,i mean did you reach back out to me i,mean i know we don't know each other,that well but somehow this tate knew,both of us yeah i mean the whole,situation creeped me out i just i want,to get a better understanding of what,the hell is going on and why i'm in it,yeah i don't know what to expect from,all of this but thanks for coming along,man what hotel we staying at when we get,there,um i actually couldn't find any hotels,this is like a pretty small rural town,there's not many options um but,remember how i told you about that,young girl on hangman road in dark bluff,maryland who,killed her family,after watching the tape we're on yeah,it's something you don't forget yeah i,remember so i did some research,and,i i don't think that house on hangman,road is the first place this tape has,been,i found a cabin in dark bluff where,a similar incident took place,and i've reached out to the lady who,rents it she's going to let us stay,there,if this tape has already been at this,cabin,somehow it's already connected it's,already appeared there i get the process,so i mean i i understand that but,that'll creep you out of you,i'm willing to do whatever it is to,figure out how i'm on this tape are you,okay with staying there before we head,out i don't want you to feel,uncomfortable about this,and look man if you feel uncomfortable,at any point let me know we will leave,marilyn welcomes us,we're heading over to dark bluff to look,into the murder suicide on hang manor,road okay,do you know about that yeah i remember,when it happened do you know about the,vhs tape that she watched that was the,reason for doing what she did,the hs tape yeah,i thought she did it because her parents,were trying to keep her from seeing some,boy or something really you said dark,bluff is a strange town well i mean,fog,randomly moves in and out and it's down,it seems like it's thundering all the,time really i don't know it's just a,strange little town,i guess wow this is that random fog that,lady was talking about this [ __ ] came,out of nowhere,yeah and as soon as we hit dark bluff,it's kind of creepy i thought she was,bullshitting,maybe there is something strange going,on in this little town that almost felt,like the appropriate way to begin this,weird-ass adventure it's moving out now,kevin should be at the end of this road,should be,here we are,this place is hidden yeah that's why i,was saying i wanted to drive,you got everything,that's not the cabin right there uh,nah this is the cabin right here that's,like a garage they use for storage or,something,[ __ ] they got a pool huh,uh,yeah,is there a lock box with a key in it or,do you have the key on you uh no the,owner said the door will be unlocked,unlock,that's what she said,it's a lot nicer than i expected,yeah,look at this view,how did you find this place uh i just,did some research into the town and i,read about what happened here,i knew it had to be connected somehow,so what's the room situation gonna be,like,and i don't know if you noticed but,i didn't see tv out there,yeah i noticed uh i'll take this room,does that work for you,i'm not getting any signal on my phone,anywhere in here dude yeah i meant to,mention that i mean we're almost 70,acres of forest but i got a hot spot on,my phone i'll give you the password,later,just remind me,uh,all the clocks are wrong,hey piano,it's very isolated out here,actually more so than i even thought it,was going to be oh,what the hell,crow,okay,this is the gallow creek cabin,in dark bluff maryland,hey james,yeah,i'm gonna start putting some of this,stuff in the fridge,you mind if i put some of your waters in,yeah that's fine put the lunch meat in,there too please figure they can start,to get cold,damn,um,now that we're here i mean,we're both trying to figure this out,i need to know what happened here,in this cabin,yeah,so,there was a lady named rose who rented,this property for a number of years,she uh she ran a daycare out of here,she also gave piano lessons to a lot of,the kids she watched,um,she had like two or three kids of her,own that lived here with her,and,in october of 96 she was watching i,think three or four kids plus her own,were here,and she closed all the windows in the,cabin,and removed the exhaust pipe on the hot,water heater releasing carbon monoxide,in here killing all the kids,she then went down to the pull out back,and drowned herself,and,she left some note talking about some,videotape she watched that made her do,this and,i know it sounds crazy but,i think that's the videotape we're on,the one she watched,i i don't understand where this tape,came from,it just feels like it appeared out of,nowhere,that's what we're here to find out,just try to talk to a few people and see,what they know about this excuse me sir,my name is daniel how you doing jack,nice to meet you this is james um we're,in dark bluff,looking into an incident that took place,here in 2015 on hangman road do you know,anything about that i guess you're,talking about that girl that killed,herself and her family yeah i think her,name was megan yeah i actually went to,school with megan i mean we weren't,close or anything like that she wasn't,there that long it was something about,she put on her dad's record player and,put some vintage music on before she did,it i actually don't know much about it,okay i remember hearing that she put,their bodies,in the closets of the house or something,like that so megan turned on her dad's,record player,before she killed her family had it,playing in the house during yeah man,it's pretty creepy [ __ ] do you know why,she did it,her parents were abusing her or,something like that and that's what i,heard do you know why she did it,honestly i have no clue did they ever,release that well i just assume crazy,people do crazy things do you know about,the vhs tape that megan found in her,house that was the reason for doing what,she did,vhs tape,she wrote in her diary that this tape,was the reason she killed her family it,does remind me of a babysitter i once,had she told us about this cursed tape,that would somehow appear,you didn't know where you didn't know,why really but you had this,uncontrollable urge,to watch it said once you watched it it,kind of got into your head why would a,tape make her do that and the scary part,was that if you saw yourself on the tape,yeah supposedly you were already dead,you already did i remember this kid,named zach i went to high school with he,was into ghost hunting and stuff like,that he was obsessed with it after the,house got demolished him and a couple,friends used to go down there at like 3,a.m and perform seances and stuff like,that,why would they go down at 3am,supposedly that's the time when making,killed her family where did she hear,this story yet i don't know she was,probably just making it all up she used,to try to scare us all the time,so how can i get in contact with her to,talk with her about this i don't know,man i was 10 years old okay i don't even,remember her name what about leo cole,the deputy that went missing from down,here what do you know about that,he ran away with some mistress i thought,i've never really heard of that i don't,really watch the news that much so you,never saw the body camera footage from,the night he disappeared,no this is the first i'm hearing about,this really,where did you guys get this information,i see his wife around town every now and,then why don't you guys go and contact,her,hello,hello ma'am um,is this nancy cole,who's calling,my name is daniel blanche uh i'm here,with my friend james,we're in dark bluff looking into the,disappearance of leo cole was he your,husband,i'm sorry i gotta go,ma'am,that's gotta be her,yeah hey man look at this,look at this,this is from the missing deputy's wife,now she wants to talk,yeah i guess so,so how far does it look did you find it,on the map,it doesn't look like it's that far from,us okay but,it looks like it's a dead end,what time is it she said meet there at,11.,it's 9 30 now,all right,she's going to come man why would she,set this up and knock him,i'm just saying there's lights there's,lights,you think that's her it's got to be her,keep the camera down put the camera down,i am i am,i got it,she was already sketchy on the phone i i,don't want her to see we're filming her,you think she's gonna get in the trunk,put the camera down i am it's down,what is she doing,she's about to get out,just just act cool i don't i don't want,her to know we're filming her,she could give us some some information,here,uh she she's coming over to the truck,just,she here she comes together she's going,down,nancy thank you for meeting with us who,are you guys,i'm daniel this is james,we're looking into your husband's,disappearance um well the night he,disappeared i don't need you looking,into this let me explain he even,disappeared and i was given no answers,yeah but do you know what happened to,him i have no clue what happened to him,and at this point i'm not even sure i,want to know it leaves me a little bit,of hope look whatever you guys are,trying to find stop,i don't have much information,but there is something strange going on,here,i know that's why we're here look on the,night your husband disappeared he,watched the videotape and,listen i don't know you guys and i don't,know what you're talking about but you,need to go back to wherever you came,from and leave this alone goodbye nancy,don't contact me again,do you know about the tape your husband,watched,on the night he vanished,what the hell was that,a waste of time,she was scared of something i feel like,i should be scared of something,she had to be overreacting,i was just,thinking how crazy this whole situation,is,i know you probably thought i was crazy,when i reached out to you and,you know i appreciate you coming on this,strange journey with me here,to look into this i'm glad you're as,interested in this as i am,it doesn't make sense,what do

working at a furniture moving,company right now it's,it's kind of wack it doesn't pay great,but,you know it's a job for now yeah i've,been there i really want to do like,documentaries,something in that field explains the,camera exactly,you married you got kids,no i'm just playing the field living a,single life,tiring yourself,uh yeah i got a daughter sarah and uh,made her mother,on and off,off right now,was that the same name on the tape sarah,yeah,see that's the most interesting part of,it to me is that certain,aspects of it were accurate you know,what i mean i my daughter was on it her,name's sarah her name was sarah on there,yeah my version that i was on alex was,there my truck was there exactly it's,like certain pieces match up,so whoever,is responsible has to maybe know us

wasn't dead,what was james knocking on this door for,last night,what the hell is that,christmas tree,it's kind of uh,he said he hasn't slept walking 20 years,and it just picks up all of a sudden,once we get here,i think there might be more to it,maybe something to do with this tape,i don't know how far down he went last,night,there's no way he came all the way down,here,it would have been pitch black,that's as far down as the land goes,uh hello,hey,uh i can't this weekend i'm away looking,into something right now,you wouldn't understand,no kate i'm not,it's something strange that i discover,i honestly don't even know what it means,yet,let me talk to her,hey sweetheart,so i'm away this weekend working okay,but i'll i'll be back on tuesday and,i'll get you,we can go roller skating if the,weather's good,okay i love you see you soon,okay bye damn not anywhere man no i,didn't see him down there at all it,started to rain while i was out there,[ __ ],who you calling,i'm calling a guy named steven ritz he,was uh the mayor of dark bluff when the,incidental hangman or road happened,i'll call him again,hello uh hello is this steven ritz,were you the mayor of dark bluff,maryland,in 2016,my name is daniel i'm looking into the,disappearance of deputy leo cole,more specifically the,tape he watched the night he vanished,uh look i don't know,what you're talking about,okay so what about the murder suicide,on hangman road you know anything about,that,what is this all about who are you,mr ritz um,i'm,the tape that little girl watched the,night she,killed her family i'm on that tape,the tape deputy leo cole watch the night,he vanished that's the same tape i'm on,that,i know this sounds crazy,don't call this number again goodbye mr,ritz,dude what the hell are they hiding,what are people doing in a town like,this,can you mean besides cover up,disappearances,i don't know,i mean there was no bar no strip club,not even a town card,yeah i don't plan on being here long,enough to find out,get in here try to figure this out and,we can leave,look if we don't figure it out all right,man i'm gonna head to bed all right all,right man good second day,hey no weird sleep walking tonight we're,all [ __ ] fine,i don't know what happened to james last,night,it was like he was in like a trance or,something,i don't know if it has anything to do,with this,this tape this cabin,i knew coming here things could get,weird i was prepared i believe in this,stuff i believe there's something really,strange going on here i don't know how,he feels,but,no matter how strange it gets i'm not,scared i,i want answers,i've become obsessed with this,it was loud as [ __ ] it woke me,up they're looking for somebody,all right,i thought i heard a piano,there it is,what,james,james what are you sleepwalking again,damn,what are you doing man,uh you're sorry man i couldn't sleep,uh i'm gonna head back to bed sorry,man just do me a favor just whatever,you're doing just hold off to the bottom,all right man,what the [ __ ],what was that,holy [ __ ],okay okay,i guess you're trying to contact us,we're just trying to figure out how,we're connected to all of this,figure out what this tape means,we don't mean any disrespect,oh,we just want to figure out how we're,connected,none of this makes any sense,[Music],i'm sorry i thought i heard a noise i,just i just came back,all night kind of freaking me out i know,man,i'm heading back to bed,holy [ __ ],so i thought that piano riff,that james or whoever that was at the,piano last night was playing sounded,familiar,i was right this is deputy leo cole in,the house on hangman a road the night he,watched that tape,listen,[Music],it's the same exact tune,i i don't know what this means,there's no way that's just a coincidence,i can't tell james about last night just,yet i don't want to scare him too soon,without being able to at least explain,what this all means i should have never,even told him about what happened in,this cabin,i guess that figure last night must have,been rose the lady who drowned herself,in the pool here,and i could have swore when i was,sleeping i felt like,cold fingers like running down my face,i don't know,okay man i'm coming,how are you doing last night,all that boys out there couldn't sleep,man playing the piano sorry about that i,was just up trying to figure out what,we're gonna do today,so what are we doing,um so from everything i gathered the,house on hangman road is the last place,this tape was at,when you're positive this is where the,house was sitting,this was 11 628 hangman a road they tore,it down in 2015.,i think it was like the day after,megan killed her family in it,it's like they were just trying to get,rid of it so if they demolish this house,then why didn't they demolish the cabin,we're staying in,that's a great question,this is the last place that the tape was,so,i figured,find the house find the tape,deputy leo cole did,i'm not getting anything on my gps,it's not on there at all,it's like they don't even want it to be,found,what a neighbor say on the tape that it,appeared at night,maybe it only appears at night,yeah he did call in at night looking for,what,anything,i mean,something that proves deputy leo cole,was here that night,james you see anything over there,james,james,jane,we can't leave,what,james you already did,yeah,i'm good man i don't i don't see,anything over here there's nothing over,here,dude are you sure,i kind of got a headache man i just can,we get out of here,all right,yeah i'm feeling better man oh good,i just opened up all the windows,we can get some fresh air in here,james so,in the 143 years that dark bluff has,existed,there's been,eight incidences similar to what,happened here,and on hangman road like,all of them,are like murder suicide type,where's that dark bluff map at,so the first incident was here,in 1980 second was,here,in 84.,third one was here in 87. fourth one was,here in 90. fifth one,was,here in 93.,the sixth one was here,at the cabin we're at in 1996 the,seventh was here in 2007,and the eighth was here what megan did,on hangman road in 2015. think they all,seen the tape no,how is that even possible,wait a second,so first,second,third what are you doing to fourth,fifth,to sixth,seventh what the [ __ ],to eight,i knew this looked familiar,look,that's from the footage you were in on,that tape holy [ __ ] it's the same symbol,how's this connected what about the,bottom piece,bottom piece,it looks like it goes from the cabin,where ahead,to the house on hangman road,the hell does that mean well what's that,centerpiece,that's the autumnwood cemetery,what come here you got to look at this,what is it investigation continues in a,chilling grave robbery the remains of a,woman stolen sometime last week the hole,is perfectly rectangular five and a half,feet deep the dirt left in neat piles to,either side,it appears that somebody had taken the,body especially a century's old town,plot with so many memories it's a very,well visited cemetery it's a you know,it's the main cemetery for this town,with motive or even reasoning still,unanswered by police it's an act that,remains too many a mystery anyone with,information on who dug up this grave is,asked to call police,what was that that's the autumnwood,cemetery,what,you know what we gotta do,so what does all this mean,i don't know,i mean this tape,just mysteriously appears in someone's,house yeah,they kill their families kill themselves,and then they're all buried in the,autumnwood cemetery,then someone or something comes and,exhumes their bodies,this is [ __ ] crazy,it's like the tape is just used as a way,to get people to the cemetery how do we,know it's not also used as a way to give,people a dark bluff,like us we're gonna have to turn the,light off on the camera put the night,vision setting on,we'll get in here look around we'll get,out,i'm not going in,what,i'm not going in man,what the hell are you talking about,that's what we're here for,no that's what you're here for not me,james this could be,this could connect everything yeah it,could we have to go or it could just be,us wandering around the [ __ ] cemetery,in the middle of the night,you're gonna make me go in there by,myself that's up to you,unbelievable,give me the goddamn camera,i can't see [ __ ],where's the new vision setting,i don't even know what i'm looking for,something in here has to,has to be related,there's gotta be something,i don't see any open graves,i don't know how big the cemetery is,i don't see [ __ ] in here,let me head back,which way did i come in,i came into the left,over there,that house,what,is there a house in a cemetery,hello,is anyone down there,james,james,hello,james can you hear me,yeah what are you

and get some,sleep uh i'm i'm sorry about this so you,didn't see anything,no,there's another dead end man,hopefully within the next 24 hours,and this all starts to make sense,it all starts to connect somehow,i mean i knew coming here that,we may not get answers,but now i can't accept that,i mean as scared as i am,i gotta finish this,sounded like the pool cover,was open,here it is again,james,whatever that was,it's close,footprints,this can't be from the pool,[Music],hello,what is going on here,hello,what,[Music],so,[Music],oh,[Music],james,i thought something was leaking uh uh

It's a sprint race.,It's, you know.,It could be done in seven minutes.,(engines rev),You really gotta be on top of your game,,and you're racing, hard,,for those 25 laps.,We're not racing a hundred-lapper,,where you can kind of take your time.,You know, you need to hammer,down and go as fast as you can.,So if you fall asleep during this,,then there's something wrong with you.,(upbeat country music),(fireworks pop),(motors rattle),- Sprint cars, they're extremely fast.,The horsepower-to-weight ratio is insane.,And it's probably why,guys like Tony Stewart,like the sport so much,,is because they kind of,afford you an adrenaline rush,like no other.,- It takes some seat,time to get used to it,,to get comfortable enough to,feel like you have control,so you can go into that corner, you know,,130, 140 miles an hour,,six inches off the next guy next to you.,Racing with the same group of guys,,you know who you can come,into a corner that close to,,and you know who to stay away from, so.,That's another fun part about it, I guess.,- [Narrator] The anatomy,of most wing sprint cars,is the same.,They are stripped down to weigh,between 1200 and 1400 pounds,and have massive engine power,,between 500 and 900 horsepower,,depending on the class.,A 25 square-foot aluminum wing,is mounted above the roll cage.,It creates downforce,,sticking the car to the track.,They have no battery, starter,,transmission, or clutch.,The right rear tire is,notably wider than the rest,,and intentionally low on air pressure,,to get better traction on,the banked track corners.,(engine rumbles),- It would be, probably,,one of the quickest,accelerating vehicles in racing,that you could possibly ride in,,in terms of going around corners.,So they have a huge amount of horsepower,and very, very little weight.,- This sport, it's the highs are so high.,I don't know if you could take,drugs to make you that happy.,It's just something that,propels you so high,,it puts you on a pedestal, you know.,People kinda like look,up to you a little bit.,But then the lows are so low,,that it just, it's a rollercoaster.,(engines revving),I understand why my father,didn't want me to get in the sport,,because one week you're,on top of the world,,next week, you're literally,at the bottom, you know.,And then you gotta drag yourself out,and work on the car harder,,come back, and be better.,- I think you see guys come back.,I mean, that's their grassroots,,that's what got 'em into the big leagues,making the big money.,And I believe at the end of the day,,I would say,the majority of them guys,would love nothing more to race the dirt.,You know, NASCAR is near and dear to 'em,because of the fortune,,the fame, the money,,the lifestyle that they, you,know, are capable of living.,But I think at the end of the day,,if they could make as much,money racing on the dirt,as they could on the blacktop,,they would, you know,,I think a lot of 'em would,switch back to the dirt.,- Tony yearned for simpler,times at the dirt track,,when he was hanging out with his pals,and people would leave him alone.,And,he,probably loved that,more than,winning the biggest race of his career,,which undoubtedly was the Brickyard.,- [Announcer] Tony,Stewart, a native Hoosier.,His dream comes true!,Tony Stewart wins the,Allstate 400 at the Brickyard!,- [Narrator] The,Indianapolis Motor Speedway,,home to the Brickyard 400,,and Canandaigua's Motorsports Park,in Ontario County, New York,,are worlds apart.,At the Brickyard in 2005,,Tony Stewart raced 160 laps,on a 2 1/2 mile asphalt track,in front of more than,a quarter million fans.,(crowd cheers),- [Announcer] That's his suite,,outside of turn two, here comes Smoke.,- [Narrator] His winning,prize was around $554,000.,(crowd cheers),- [Crowd] You're the man! Tony!,(crowd cheers),- [Narrator] When he,entered a sprint car race,at Canandaigua's half-mile track in 2014,,just a few thousand fans filled,the front stretch stands.,The winner was slated to take home $1500.,- You know, why he was there,that night racing for $1500?,I don't have an answer.,But,,I do know how aggressive he is,to race like that.,The year before, almost to date,,he caused the accident,that the girl ended up with a broken back.,(race cars buzzing),(crowd yelling),15 cars got involved, ours was one of 'em.,It broke, ruined our,chassis, and got bent up,over him doing some,stupid move in the front,that shoulda never happened.,It was the second, third,lap of the race, you know,,and he's making moves that,,the weekly guys that we race against,would never have done it.,- The people love the sprint cars.,They're flipping, they're crashing,,they're, you know, wrecking equipment,,and that's all part of it.,You know, we don't like crashing,,we don't like flipping,and destroying race cars.,It costs a lot of money.,But,,at the same time,,I think it's a lot of fun to,put a show on for the fans.,(rhythmic upbeat music),(crowd cheers),- Everybody's happy at the,racetrack, for the most part.,You know, you have bad nights,,but you look at the fans,and everybody's smiling,and laughing and cheering and waving,,and that's the fun part of it.,The kids, to me, to see,the little kids out there,and you know, trying,to walk up to the fence,and waving to us and stuff.,That's, I get a kick out of that.,(motors rev),(wistful music),- [Reporter] Witnesses at the,Canandaigua Motorsports Park,say the crash was like a,scene from a horror movie.,Around 10:30 Saturday night,,NASCAR champion Tony Stewart,collided with and killed,20 year-old competitor, Kevin Ward Jr.,- It's kind of all a blur at this point,,but something that I'll never forget,is Kevin, you know, going through the air,,limp, you know, and just,,I've never seen that before, you know,,and I hope I never see,it again, but it just.,Didn't look like a person, you know?,It's almost like you take a fire suit,and throw it up in the air.,- He got out of his car.,He ran out in the middle of the track.,He pointed at Tony.,Tony took one more lap around,and he stood right there,in front of the car,and Tony never stopped.,And that's all she wrote.,- He was really excited.,I mean, I could see,,like when I arrived at,the track that night,,like I could see like the joy in him.,Like I could tell he was just so happy,that his car was running,,it was hooked, you know,,it was doing exactly,what he wanted it to do.,Like, he knew he had a good,chance to do really well.,- And then to see Tony pull up that night,,that was a big deal, you know?,Because we just broke into this division,and now we're gonna be racing against him.,And then to be running, you know,,I shouldn't say door-to-door,,because he was definitely,a little bit better,than we were that night,,you know, it was kind of a big deal for us,to try to keep up and try to learn,,especially from a veteran driver,,on lines and where to run.,- Kayla was there with their little,,with my grandson there, Landon.,And Kevin's still working on his car.,Landon, he was always involved,,you know, working on the car too.,I mean, he was only four years old,,but he was interested in it,,and had wrenches in his hand all the time.,- I remember he was,standing in the trailer.,I think he was probably texting,his girlfriend really quick.,And I told him, ""I'm gonna,go up in the stands now."",""Good luck, bud,"" you know.,And he just looked at me,and he says, ""Thanks, Mama."",And I went up to the stands.,Kevin pushed him out.,And I remember right before,he went on the track,,he told me that, you know,,the last thing he said to Kevin was,,""It's gonna be a good night tonight, Pa."",I mean I just think that just goes to show,how much he really,wanted to win this race.,- [Announcer] Everybody falls in line,where they need to be,behind the pace truck.,And the next time by,,we will turn them loose with the green.,- And it come across the radio, you know,,""Drivers get ready for the A main,"",'cause weather's moving in.,- [Announcer] And Tommy,Wickham in row two.,Darryl Ruggles and,Kevin Ward in row three.,Jessica Zemken and Cory,Sparks in row four.,Jeff Cook and Steve Poirier in row five.,Scott Kreutter and Tony,Stewart in row number six.,- I was up in the grandstands,with my family and everything,,and it was something I always,did on a regular basis.,Like if Kevin spun out,,or if I thought there was any chance,that he could have gotten,hurt or anything like that,,I always go down and check on him.,(motors rumbling),- Well, the accident happened on lap 13.,- [Newscaster] Stewart's number 14 car,seems to make contact with,Kevin Ward Jr.'s 13 car,,which you see hits the,wall and spins out. Now-,- When you're a big star,and you go to a place like Canandaigua,,you always have,sort of the,situation like the,fastest gun in the West,,where you have these,local guys who are like,,""I don't care who he is,,he's not running over me."",- [Announcer] Into turn number one.,Tries to slow the slider.,Oh! And we've got Ward into the wall!,Ward into the wall!,He bounces it over the cushion,,and off the wall into turn number one.,We are under caution.,- The weekly racers know how,each one, each driver races.,And they know Kevin's a, you know,,hammer down, up on the top.,When you slide him, you'd,better give him some room,,or you're gonna make contact with him.,Well, Tony, not being a,weekly racer with him,,just slid him so close, you know,,actually clipped him, the front end.,- A slide job is on a dirt track.,When you go in the turn,,you're low in the turn,,and you get more traction,and fly outta the turn,and slide across in front of,the car you're racing against.,In other words, for a lot of,times, there's two grooves.,There's one guy low, one guy high.,They start to surge ahead,,then the guy on the outside has more RPMs,and he goes back by.,A slide job is when that guy on the bottom,goes extra hard into the turn,,and slides up the higher groove,and that's the way he makes the pass.,- [Announcer] And Kevin,Ward's coming out of his car.,He is looking for somebody.,- That's not abnormal.,Usually you get out and you,take your steering wheel,and you chuck it at the other car,,or you run out there and you wave 'em down,and flip 'em the bird, or you know.,Obviously, when you end,up in the wall, you know,,you're not happy, you know.,And everybody has a right to be,,there's a lot of money on the line,,and a lot of pride, a lot of ego.,- Look, it is part of the ethic of racing.,There's no doubt about it.,And you're right, Tony Stewart,,regardless of this incident,,separate from this incident,,has made a career, in some ways,,of having a hotheaded personality.,Fans love him for it.,It is part of the reason,he has made so much money.,You gotta take a look at this.,This is from a few years ago,,an incident with Matt Kenseth.,He and Tony Stewart get tangled up.,Stewart feels that Kenseth,knocked him out of a winning,position in the race.,And what does he do?,He walks onto the track, in,front of a car, basically,,and throws his helmet at Kenseth.,You tell me how close this is.,- You know, we know,that it wasn't a smart,decision that Kevin made,to get out on the track,,to get out of his car.,We acknowledge that, we know that.,But I strongly feel like,that shouldn't have cost,him his life, either.,(foreboding music),- [Announcer] And Kevin,Ward's coming out of his car.,He is looking for somebody.,He is looking for,,I believe it was Tony Stewart.,- [Spectator] Oh, my God!,- [Speaker] Red, red, red, red, red, red!,(dramatic music),- When Tony did a slide job,,and I see him spin and hit the wall,,I immediately started down the stands.,I wanted to go see him.,Meantime, while I was,going down the stands,,that other lap occurred.,And that's when he got hit.,- Seeing Kevin get out of his car,,seeing him, you know, he,was coming down the track,,I thought he was actually,coming to my car.,Me and Kevin have,,I might have ran him,outta room in that race.,So I thought he might have been mad at me.,Came at my car.,I gassed it, swerved away,from him, and said to myself,,that next guy in line was,probably gonna hit him.,- I saw him come down the track to,,I believe to yell at Tony Stewart,for the little,fender-bender they got into,,which,unfortunately,,was common.,We couldn't get to him in time.,Usually if we can get to 'em in time,,we can put a car in the way, you know?,(somber piano music),- There was this big cop in front of me.,He was big and you know, muscles.,I just wanted to get by him so bad.,I just wanted to go over,there, and you know,,I remember like begging,him and pleading with him,,""Please let me over there."",Like, ""I need to be,with my son right now."",It never happened, they,never let me go over there.,Five minutes went by, 10 minutes went by.,15, 20 minutes went by, and,they were still doing CPR.,I'm a nurse, so I kinda,knew that it wasn't good.,- Once the ambulance got there,,we ended up putting 'em in the ambulance.,I was in the back of,the ambulance doing CPR,all the way to Thompson Hospital.,- [Interviewer] And when you,got to Thompson Hospital,,did the healthcare,professionals take over?,- They took over.,As soon as we backed up and,opened the doors, they came in.,Well, we got 'em out and I was doing CPR.,One of their nurses continued CPR,all the way into, the rest,of the way into the hospital.,- Operator of the car that was struck,was transported to Thompson,Hospital in Canandaigua,by ambulance.,At the hospital, the,operator was pronounced,dead on arrival.,- Seeing it with your two eyes,,and people are coming up to,you that night and going,,""Kevin's not with us anymore."",""Kevin's dead,"" you know.,And just saying, ""No, he's not."",""No, there's no way."",- I,,just felt like I,,like the only thing I could do was pray.,Like, I needed more,help, I needed to pray.,Like I just, I knew it was bad.,I knew it wasn't good.,I went out to one of the,nurses at the desk there,,and I asked her like, ""Do you,guys have a chapel somewhere?,Do you have somewhere that I can go?,Like, I need to say a few prayers.,Is there a chapel here in the hospital?"",And she looked at me and she says,,""I think you should go,back in the waiting room,,because the doctor's gonna,be coming in to talk to you."",So at that point I knew he was gone.,- As far as affecting the local, you know,,the local community,,everybody,took it pretty hard.,Sorry.,(clears throat),It still,,it still,hurts.,(quiet piano music),(go-kart sputters),- I hate that my brother's not there.,That wasn't our plan.,He was supposed to be,,it was the Ward Racing Team, with Papa,,and you know, Uncle Kevin, and,my son and my other nephew,,you know, they were going to be a team.,And that team's not complete anymore.,- I hate the fact that my son's death,is on the internet for everybody,to see,,over and over and over again.,And that was really hard for us to accept.,- [Spectator] Tony Stewart,just hit that guy, Alex!,Tony Stewart just hit that guy!,- This is something that will definitely,affect my life forever.,This is a sadness and a pain,that I hope no one ever has,to experience in their life.,That being said,,I know that the pain and the mourning,that Kevin Ward's family,and friends are experiencing,is something that I,can't possibly imagine.,I want Kevin's father, Kevin Sr.,,and his mother, Pam,,and his sisters, Christi,and Kayla and Katelyn,,to know that every day,I'm thinking about 'em,and praying for them.,- He never,,never came over to any of us that night,,never came to the hospital,,never to ask how we were doing.,Never contacted-,- He never showed any concern for us.,Like there was, there was no,concern for us whatsoever.,Like, he never checked,on Kevin that night.,He never checked afterwards to,see, like, how we were doing.,He never...,It's like we weren't,even a thought of his.,Like, I don't understand.,I don't know how I can forgive somebody,when he seems to have no remorse.,- [Court Official] Do you,swear to tell the truth,,the whole truth, and,nothing but the truth,,so help you, God?,- Yes.,- [Court Official] Thank you.,- [Interviewer] State your name, sir.,- Anthony Wayne Stewart.,- [Interviewer] Mr. Stewart,,do you believe that a,operator of a motor vehicle,should not steer that motor,vehicle toward a pedestrian?,- Absolutely.,(tense music),- [Interviewer] At any point from when,you first saw Mr. Ward's car,,well, at any point after that,,did you apply the throttle to your car?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] When did you do that?,- (sighs) In-between the time,,the first time I saw him,to after Chuck Hebing went past him,and I realized he was,running down the racetrack,toward me.,- [Interviewer] Okay.,For what purpose did you,apply throttle to your car?,- [Tony] To try to drive,the car down to the left,,to get away from him.,- [Interviewer] And was that,immediately prior to the impact,between him and your car?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] And if you,apply throttle in that situation,and steer to the left,,isn't the back of your car,gonna slide to the right?,- It did in that scenario, yes.,- [Interviewer] But that's the,typical way it's gonna move.,- Not necessarily.,- [Interviewer] What,other way would it move?,- [Tony] I mean, depending,on the track conditions,,if the track's really sticky, it wouldn't,,it may not move at all.,- I was behind him,,right directly behind him,going into turn one and two,,and they were telling us to stay low,,and I started to come down a little bit,,and I could see Tony's left,front wheel turn to the right,,closer in the direction,of where Kevin was,,up higher onto the race track.,And then I could see,,I was on the, just underneath him,and I could look up and see,,I could see Kevin still,there in front of his car,and with his hands in the air.,And,I saw the rear of the car stand up,and the dust come off the rear tires,as Tony hit the throttle.,- [Interviewer] And then?,- And then when he hit the throttle,,the rear of the car came around,,and the front end of the,car went to the left,,the car got sideways.,And he struck Kevin.,- And as I believe he saw,Ward pointing at him,,he started to drift up,the track towards him.,And then Ward was moving,his feet quick (fingers tap),and,,like stutter-stepping,,as Stewart was coming at him.,And then Stewart hit the gas,,the car turned sideways, and,I didn't see Ward anymore.,- [Interviewer] What makes,you comfortable saying,that you think Mr. Stewart hit the gas?,- You could hear the car rev.,- [Interviewer] And did you,,do you feel comfortable that,you can associate that rev,with Mr. Stewart's car?,- Yes.,- I saw Tony's car,go up,,and then he gassed it and came back down,,and he collected Kevin into his rear tire.,And then he was thrown,approximately 70 feet.,- I mean, we said from day one,that it looked like he,had moved up the track,and obviously hit the throttle.,And I know them cars,,what they do when you hit the throttle,,you know, it fishtails out,the back end to the right.,So, you know, we're like,,""Why'd he hit the throttle?"",- Tony's car, there whether, yeah,,I don't know what he was doing.,You know, I'm not in his head.,All I know is that,the rear tires lifted right up,,blew up big and skinny,and the dust rolled off of 'em.,And next thing you know,,Kevin's flying through the air.,I don't know,,I don't know if he was,driving straight at him.,I don't know if he was,getting on the throttle,to try to miss him,and try to get down to the,bottom of the racetrack.,I don't know.,There's a split second,there that I can't see.,- [Interviewer] You saw Mr. Ward struck,,and then did you ever see him move again?,- No, I saw him,,I saw Tony make impact,and strike Kevin,and I saw Kevin going through the air,and I immediately turned onto the left.,I tried to look and,,no.,- It's inconceivable for me to believe,that Tony Stewart intentionally,hurt another driver.,But it is not inconceivable,for me to believe,that Tony felt like he,was protecting his turf.,You may have said, ""I'll,fix his young ass,"",but you've done it 1,000,times and no one's got hurt.,And there is a tragedy,,there is a comedy of,errors that takes place.,But I'm positive that Tony,didn't try to kill somebody.,I think that he tried to say,,""I'm Tony Stewart, you,don't mess with me."",But I think it was probably,something that had happened 1,000 times,and nothing bad ever happened.,(haunting music),- But again, I want to please emphasize,and make it clear that,at this very moment,,there are no facts in hand,that would substantiate or,support a criminal charge,or indicate criminal intent,on the part of any individual.,(suspenseful music),(staccato music),(staccato music continues),- [Interviewer] Would you,state your name please, sir?,- My name is John C. Abraham.,I'm an investigator,for the Ontario County,Sheriff's Department.,- [Interviewer] Let me let you look at,what we've marked as Exhibit 13.,Do you recognize that?,- Yep.,- [Interviewer] And what is it?,- That's a statement I,took from Mr. Stewart,on,August 9th, 2014.,I started typing at 11:49 p.m.,- [Interviewer] And was,that a recorded statement,that was later transcribed, or were you-,- No, it was, I typed it.,(keyboard clicking),- He says,,""We came around turn two under caution,,because the driver that stepped,out of his car had crashed.,When I came around turn,two, there was Chuck,,he was in the car in front of me,,and the driver was,running down the racetrack,and almost ran into Chuck's car.,And when Chuck went by,,he was running at me,because he was upset,that I was the car next,to him when he crashed.,And he stepped right in front,of the car and I swerved,,and then I felt my right rear,tire make contact with him."",What are your thoughts,on that first statement?,- That was his first story.,He seen Kevin walking toward the 45.,He seen him walking toward his car.,So that was the first story.,Well, the last story was,that he lost track of him or whatever,,but I mean, that was the,original story there, so.,- Mr. Stewart said that,he attempted to swerve,and that he felt the right rear tire,impact Mr. Ward.,- [Interviewer] That's,the general substance,of your first conversation,with Mr. Stewart that night?,- That's the only conversation I had.,- [Interviewer] Oh, I misheard you.,I thought I heard you say you,talked to him more than once.,- Nope, that was the only time.,(high-pitched music),- [Narrator] Tony Stewart's,nine-question conversation,with police officers,is written up in less than half a page.,After the first answer,,Stewart spoke a total of 57,words and the interview ended.,- [Interviewer] Going out,to investigate that evening,,did you follow super sprint racing?,- I did not, I still don't.,I did not know any, I mean,,I don't follow sprint racing at all.,Like I said, it's actually the first time,I've ever had to go to the,race track for an incident,,you know, since, in 27 years.,- [Interviewer] Have you,ever done an investigation,of any sort of race car or crash?,- No, I have not.,- [Interviewer] Prior to this,one, I guess I should say.,Is that fair?,- [Deputy Rago] That's correct.,- [Interviewer] So what's,typed up on exhibit 13,is what Mr. Stewart said to you,that night, is that correct?,- [Investigator] Correct.,- [Interviewer] He didn't,say anything to you,,about, for instance,,what his position was on the,track prior to the collision.,Is that fair?,- [Investigator] That's fair.,- [Interviewer] He did,not say anything to you,about whether he applied,the throttle to his vehicle,at any point prior to the crash?,- No, he did not.,- I don't know that they,asked the right questions,on the night of the accident.,They had heard what happened.,They had heard that Kevin Ward,stepped in front of Tony Stewart's car.,They're gonna think, you know,,""Blame is on Kevin Ward.,Tony Stewart was just a,hapless victim in all this.,And you know, he's probably,a little bit upset about it,,and we're gonna go easy on him."",- ""Oh, he just stepped,in the front of my car."",Was that true or not? Okay.,They have no basis to say is,that really what did happen.,But just general appearance is, you know,,""Car is going here and,the guy is hit by the car,,so he must step into the car."",That's what their reasoning was.,They have no base or science,or anything like that.,- [Interviewer] When you had a chance,to meet with Mr. Stewart,that evening, August 9,,did you have the impression,that he was aware of what,had occurred on the track?,- [Investigator] Absolutely.,- [Interviewer] Did he,show any signs or symptoms,of any kind of impairment to you?,- No, I actually even asked him as well.,I didn't smell it, I,didn't sense anything.,He was just very upset, very distraught.,- I most definitely think,they should have tested him.,They tested my son.,My son didn't have an option,whether he got tested or not.,Why shouldn't have Tony have been tested?,If there's a fatality, you just do it.,They basically asked Tony, you know,,""Did you have any alcohol?,Did you ever do any drugs tonight?"",or something like that.,""Nope? Okay."",That was good enough for them.,- We're looking at clothing,,we're looking at lighting,,we're looking for eyewitnesses,that were working.,We're looking for any information now,that will assist us in this investigation.,Again, it's less than 16 hours old.,It's ongoing.,- [Reporter] Are you,looking into the possibility,that Stewart may have,swerved at the last minute,,deliberately, waiting,until the last minute,to get out of the way?,- This is an ongoing investigation,and we are looking at any information,that's relevant to the crash.,- We got the sense that night that,,like something wasn't right,,just the way that Sheriff,Povero was talking to us,and how he didn't want to answer,some of my questions that I had for him.,And when I'd ask him direct,questions about the case,and what they were gonna,do and stuff, like,,he literally just like turned away from me,and like wouldn't even,look me in the eye anymore.,And I thought that was so strange.,(dramatic music),(dramatic music continues),- New tonight at 10, the grand jury,that will determine if,NASCAR's Tony Stewart,will face charges for,killing another driver,met for the first time today.,- Yes, the charges that,were submitted to the grand,jury for consideration,were manslaughter in the second degree,and criminally negligent homicide.,- Drivers are trying to stay,focused on what's ahead,,but they say the prosecutor's pursuit,to be sure it was all an,accident is a setback.,- He's going through the dickens,since the whole thing happened,,and now his fate is in,the hands of a jury.,That's a pretty tough deal.,- I mean, I've been in a court for,,you know, speeding,tickets, (laughs) you know?,But,,I didn't know what to expect.,I've never even been to that courthouse.,Then you walk in,,and there's all your fellow,racers, there are a bunch there,,you know, you got five or,six of us that are there.,They all have lawyers.,- [Documentarian] But you didn't feel like,you needed one?,- I didn't think I needed one,until I walked in the door,and everybody else was lawyered up.,Then I said, ""Well, maybe,I shoulda had somebody."",- What cost him his life was,the actions of Tony Stewart.,Him moving up the track,,when he was being told to stay,low and slow on the track,,accelerating under a caution,,sliding his car sideways,,(indistinct) his tires.,You know, those are the actions,that took my son's life.,- The difficult part is,if it was a road accident,,you know, everybody in,the jury understands.,They either drive or they have a car,or they've been in a car.,(dramatic music),The people there have, I'd,probably put money on it,,never been to a race, you know,,never been around a race car.,They just don't understand.,They didn't have a breakdown.,They didn't even have a car there to say,,""This is what a car looks like.,And this is, you know, this is stagger,,this tire's bigger than this tire.,And this is where the throttle is,,this is where the brake pedal is.,This motor has 700 horse, you know,,on a car that weighs 1400 pounds."",It's difficult to explain to somebody,that doesn't have a clue.,- Well, the videos actually,did not demonstrate any,aberrational driving by Tony Stewart,until the point of impact with Kevin Ward,,at which point his vehicle,veered to the right up the track,,as a result of the collision.,Prior to that, his course,was pretty straight.,(motor revs),- Some of our lawyers told us, like,,""Proof is in the video.,Like, just let them do their job.,All they have to do is watch the video.,They can see what happened.,Like, don't hound them, you know,,don't bother them all the time,,just let them do your job,,you're gonna be good.,Just let 'em go ahead,and just do the video."",One of my biggest regrets yet.,- [Interviewer] If you assume,he did not move to the right,,but continued on the line he was on,,do you think he would've missed Mr. Ward?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] Can you,think of any good reason,why Mr. Stewart would've,turned his tires to the right?,- No.,- [Interviewer] Do you,think it's common knowledge,among sprint racers,that if you,are moving at caution speeds,and apply throttle,,that it's gonna cause the rear right,,the rear of your car,to slide out to the right?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] Can you,think of a good reason,why Mr. Stewart would've applied throttle,right before the impact with Mr. Ward?,- No.,- After listening to and,questioning all of the witnesses,and reviewing all of the evidence,,the grand jury has determined,that there is no basis,to charge Tony Stewart with any crimes.,His case was, therefore, no,billed by the grand jury.,(gentle music),- [Speaker] A grand jury in,Ontario County, New York,,has decided there is no basis,for any criminal charges,relating to Tony Stewart's role,in the August 9th death of Kevin Ward Jr.,during a sprint car race.,The grand jury had met Tuesday,to hear evidence from District,Attorney Michael Tantillo,,and quickly determined charges,would not be necessary.,Stewart being cleared of any wrongdoing,is a tremendous boost,for the NASCAR community,,where Stewart has many,supporters among drivers,,crew members, and their families.,- I mean, our son is gone.,We're never gonna see our son again.,And nobody has,,Tony has not been held,accountable for that at all.,Not being charged with anything,,not spending one day in jail,,which I feel he should,be in jail right now.,I have to live with that every day.,And that is so hard,to think that my son's death,has gone unaccountable.,We've gotten no justice for our son.,- Most people, they lose a family member,,and you know, they go,through the calling hours,,they go through a funeral,,they put 'em in the ground,,and then, you know, you can start healing,and you start moving on.,I feel like my family,was never given that.,- Maureen, startling revelations today.,Victim Kevin Ward Jr.,was high on marijuana,the night he stepped out of,his race car on a live track,and was struck and killed by Tony Stewart.,- There is toxicology evidence in the case,relating to Kevin Ward,that actually indicated that,at the time of operation,,he was under the influence of marijuana.,- I'm not surprised.,I mean, young kid, high on marijuana.,Famous, famous person gets off, you know.,Did they do a blood test on Stewart, too?,- [Newscaster] Stewart was not tested.,A drug expert interviewed,Stewart the night of the crash,and determined he was,not under the influence,of drugs or alcohol.,- I don't think it made,any difference, at all.,But it comes off as,,""Well, he was high and that's,why he got outta the car."",No, he got outta the car,cause he was pissed off.,You know.,It had nothing to do with it.,- When they seen the fact that,Kevin had THC in his system,,that was their ticket.,It was Tony's ticket to freedom.,Like, that was the means,,what they needed to use,to give them justification,or a motive to be able to clear Tony.,- [Narrator] That THC was present,during his postmortem autopsy,lab work is indisputable.,But the questions that,cannot be answered by science,are whether Kevin Ward Jr.,was impaired by his marijuana use,,and how long it had been,since he last used the drug.,- No way.,No way did he have, had,been smoking marijuana.,I'm saying, well, Friday,morning we left to go to Canada,,you know, eight o'clock in the morning.,So,,I have no idea when he'd had to smoke,the five hours before he got in that car.,There's no way possible.,- All right, my name's Michael Holland.,I'm a medical toxicologist,and occupational medicine physician.,I do a lot of investigations for,forensic toxicology is one,of my special interests,,and postmortem is,,most of forensic toxicology,is postmortem toxicology.,The carboxy THC, the one that's 78,,that's an inactive metabolite.,That can be 2,000 and not impairing.,It's not an impairing drug.,Well, you know, a living person at 13.1,would exhibit all these,different impairment things,,and you would see all,these different things.,You can't say that from a,postmortem central blood specimen.,You just can't.,You know, and from aortic blood,,I can almost guarantee you,that that's not what his,antemortem blood level was.,Almost assuredly it would be less,,because that's a long postmortem interval,and it's from central blood,,and we know it exhibits,postmortem redistribution.,- The levels that were determined,were enough to impair judgment, yes.,- [Announcer] The 28, going,after Kevin Ward's number 13,off the turn,,as Ward able to keep the position,,as Ward trying to reel in,the Paul Kinney number,19K, as Jason Barney-,- It's hard for me to imagine,someone who's acutely high on marijuana,to be able to, A, negotiate,that kind of a scenario,,and drive that fast and safely do it;,and B, even making that decision,that it would be safe to do that.,You know, ""I'm gonna go get high."",- [Announcer] The 13 of Kevin Ward,holding on to position number,six, Jeff Cook is seventh.,- Those levels in your system,consistently continue to,rise after someone passes.,So the fact that Kevin might,have had THC in his system,,the fact that it could,have been, you know,,a low level where it wouldn't,have showed impairment,,or, I'm not even sure what,they would consider impairment,,but they waited 39 hours,to test his blood for that?,- And then we were told it's a,matter of how the body's laid,and where they draw the blood from.,- [Chris Halsne] You don't,think justice has been served?,- Not at all.,Not at all.,I ask myself, ""Why?"" every day.,I do, I mean is it just,because it's who he is?,I mean, why didn't they charge,him with one single thing?,- And that was the reason,the civil suit come about.,You know, civil suits are about money.,We told 'em from day one,,we don't want 10 cents,of Tony Stewart's money.,We don't need 10 cents,of Tony Stewart's money.,We just wanted answers to what happened,,and you know,,it may sound mean, but,,put him through some of what,we went through, you know.,(quiet music),(tense music),- Right now, in the last 30 minutes,,we've learned that NASCAR,driver Tony Stewart,is being sued by the,family of Kevin Ward Jr.,for a deadly 2014 dirt track accident.,(serious music),- I am Richard Ziernicki.,I am President and CEO,of Knott Laboratory,,consulting engineering,firm in Denver, Colorado.,I have been doing this type,of work about 35 years.,That means this investigation,of motor vehicle accidents,and industrial accidents.,- The beauty of solving this,project with videogrammetry,is that we get to change our perspective.,We get to see this accident,from a different vantage point.,We actually have the video.,- [Colleague] It's layer one.,- As layer one, yes.,This is our video.,So if you were to watch the video,,you're gonna see it's all over the place.,And we have to be able to calibrate,and analyze this video,footage for each video frame,,because it's such a rapid,succession of changing,video and camera properties.,And we need to be able to solve,for all those multiple,different vantage points.,- There's nothing more,than just series of images.,All the camera we deal with,,currently they are about,30 frames per second.,Those are a series of images,,still images, okay?,So the video, what you see,,we fooling your eye by telling,you something is moving.,Nothing is moving.,Series of videos.,Your eye take this as a motion,,but there is no motion,actual on those images.,And to run the program, it,took like four or five minutes.,Now it takes a couple seconds.,Boom, done. The same.,So speed of the computers,change so dramatically.,- Every new case is a new challenge,,and it's like putting a puzzle together.,So that's why I enjoy it.,There were,spectators,filming this.,There was a track camera filming this.,There were GoPro cameras, or the like,,in at least several of,the vehicles on the track.,So this was all being recorded,,and,,once it happened,,it helped to untangle the videos,,helped untangle what actually occurred.,- The reason we are hired,,because there was no definite answer,what really happened on scientific level.,We have deposition, we have,statement, we have video.,But the video,,you can look on the video all your life,and you cannot comprehend,the depth of the video,,where the things are in relation,,depth in the video.,Because the nature of human eye,,we don't have ability to,read depth on a video.,How far they are apart.,Are they two inches apart,or five inches apart?,Your body, your brain, your,eye cannot figure out that.,We need to digest that from that video.,And in combining this,with the 3D scanning,,now we can do that.,- In this case, I think we had,hundreds of millions of data,points based on our laser scan.,We understand exactly where,these points in space are,,and then when we have a vehicle,moving through that space,,we know what its vehicle dynamics are,,we know where its position in space is,,and we can quite accurately tell,exactly the location of the,vehicle and how it's behaving.,- And that's the beauty of physics, right?,You can break the laws of man,,but you can't break the laws of physics.,Okay.,And,,by golly,,Tony Stewart stepped on his throttle.,When he applied throttle,,the car rotated and kicked the right end,,okay, so the passenger,side rear of the car out.,And what that did,is it kicked it right into,where Kevin Ward was standing.,And the right rear wheel,,just, it's very gummy,,it's like, sort of like,a spongy-type material.,It probably just, you know,,sucked Kevin Ward right into it.,And that was, unfortunately,,the end for Kevin Ward.,- Each frame we can figure out,acceleration or,deceleration of the vehicle.,And we did.,And each frame we can figure out,your angle or fishtailing of the vehicle,,and quantify that, how many degree.,Not just roughly left or right.,No, specifically.,That was the beauty of that analysis.,It's not the guess work,,it's not the judgment.,There is not no judgment whatsoever.,It is what that video shows.,We found not what he did, but,we found what the car did.,Okay? Difference, huge difference.,And we can potentially extrapolate that,because the car didn't do anything,unless you step on the gas, right?,So if you step on the,gas, the car will respond.,But we analyzed not the human behavior,,we analyzed the car response.,But the car responded to human action,,human,applying steering angle,,applying this, applying that.,So the car did accelerate.,There is no base or reason,for car to accelerate,unless you step on the gas.,So yes, driver forced,that car to accelerate.,- We tracked every single,race car that we could,that went by Kevin Ward prior to impact,,so that we could see what their path was,,see what their speeds were,,how were they reacting to this hazard,that was in the racetrack.,And what we found is that these other cars,were, in fact, following,caution procedures,of staying low on the track,,and they were avoiding the,area where Kevin Ward was.,In the video that you will see,,there are paths that demonstrate,the paths of each of those vehicles,that went by Kevin Ward,prior to the accident.,Kevin Ward never stepped,beyond the path of those six vehicles.,He never got in their way, so to speak.,So,,it isn't until Tony Stewart comes by,,you see all these six paths, right?,And then Tony Stewart,makes a diagonal line,straight through those other paths,,in the direction of Kevin Ward.,- [Documentarian] When you just look,,again, I'm talkin' YouTube,,you're just eyeballing this thing,,it looks like Mr. Ward,is moving down the track,and he kind of steps,into Tony Stewart's path.,You found that didn't,,that isn't true.,- That's not true.,So again, based on the videos,,and based on the videogrammetry,,Kevin Ward did come down the track,from the location that his car was at,,but he stopped at a certain line.,He didn't come very close,to the previous six cars,,low on the track.,He didn't walk all the way down the track.,He stayed relatively high, okay.,And he wasn't coming down,into the path of Tony Stewart.,Again, should Kevin Ward,have been out of his car?,No, he should not have.,But, after he got out of his car, okay,,he stayed rather high in the track.,And if it weren't for Tony Stewart,,this incident wouldn't have occurred.,- He stopped, and his upper body,moved away from Tony Stewart.,He did not make a move into the vehicle.,He kept walking, then he stood,for a split second before impact,and upper body, not leg,,upper body move away from car,when he was hit.,- It's not until he accelerates,and hits the throttle,that his vehicle would,,you know, act accordingly.,You know, if you're gonna hit the throttle,in a lightweight, high-horsepower vehicle,,it's gonna kick the rear end out,and it's gonna throw up dirt,and it's gonna do all the,things that a car would do,if you're gonna stone a competitor.,But when you're doing,that type of maneuver,,the vehicle's also gonna,have a tendency to drift.,And,the drifting,would actually cause the,vehicle to go up the track.,- I don't believe Tony,Stewart was truthful,in answering why he applied his throttle.,(somber music),- Well,,it happens in racing,,but normally people don't get killed.,And,I do think,that it's absurd,to think that it was,,that it was intentional.,I mean,,it would be no more, say,,uncommon than say,,a horse-collar tackle in football,,or a beanball in baseball,,or a grabbing the face mask, you know?,I mean, it's something,,it's sort of a, I mean.,There's an implication in the word stoning,that sounds more sinister,than it is, you know.,- [Interviewer] ""He left,his lane and hit the gas,and to me it just like, it,looks like it was intentional."",Do you want to modify that sentence?,- Well, I don't know if I would,put intentional there again,,not knowing how those turn.,And one of the things that,we've seen in the past,at Canandaigua Motor Speedway,is they like to throw,dirt in people's face.,All right?,That's intentional.,Hitting somebody, maybe,not so intentional.,I don't know.,But I've seen people throw,dirt in other people's faces.,- [Interviewer] That seems,like a bad idea to do that.,- Very bad idea.,Bad idea getting out of the car,,bad idea doing that as well.,Two wrongs don't ever make a right.,- We've maintained this from day one.,We don't think Tony,intentionally meant to hit and kill Kevin.,- No, absolutely not.,- We honestly feel,that he just wanted to intimidate him.,He was upset with him.,Whatever his motive was.,Like, you know, put a show on for people.,I don't know what Tony's motives were.,But I strongly feel that,he went up the track,and tried to throw dirt on my son.,I don't think he meant,to hit him and kill him,,but that's what happened.,- [Interviewer] You didn't,hit Kevin Ward Jr. on purpose?,- Absolutely not.,- [Interviewer] You didn't,try to slide a little bit,,throw mud on him?,- You can't throw mud on somebody,when you haven't got to him.,The mud from the tire would go behind you,,so you can't throw mud forward.,It would throw it backwards.,And there wasn't any mud to,throw in the first place.,- [Interviewer] So your,answer to my question,is no, you didn't do that.,- No, not at all.,- [Interviewer] All right.,Are you aware that sprint,car racers do that sometimes,,or have done it?,- Yeah.,- [Interviewer] And that's, you agree,,that's a terrible idea, right?,- I've been around sprint,car racing a long time.,It's part of the sport.,- [Interviewer] Right,,but it's a bad idea,,even though it's part of the sport.,- I've never seen anybody get hurt,by throwing mud at somebody.,- We live in a society,where people constantly wring their hands,and they say, ""He coulda killed somebody!"",Or,,you know, it's like,,""Don't shoot that BB gun.,You might put somebody's eyes out!"",Well, the great majority of,people that shoot BB guns,don't put somebody's eyes out.,But sometimes it happens.,- I wasn't trying to slide anywhere.,I was trying to drive underneath him,,and get away from him.,- [Interviewer] I'm just,talking about in general.,You wouldn't wanna slide your,car around or near someone,,because you have less control,over your car on a slide,than you do when you're,just driving it, right?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] That,would increase the risk,that you might hit somebody, right?,- Yes.,- [Interviewer] So that's,a terrible idea, right?,- Correct.,- [Interviewer] And your,testimony under oath,was you were not gonna do that-,- I didn't say-,- [Interviewer] to Kevin Ward Jr.,- I was not trying to slide at him, no.,- [Interviewer] Nor throw mud on him.,- No.,- [Interviewer] All right.,- So Tony Stewart obviously,thinks he did something else,than what we found.,And what's interesting is that,is Tony Stewart's reality.,That's what he believes that he did.,If they say to stay low, you stay low.,Okay, you don't go high.,And,I don't,,I'm not a mind reader.,I don't know what he was thinking.,But I can talk about the,physics in what happened.,And what happened was,he not only went high,,but once he got high and got,close to where Kevin Ward was,,he decided to step on his throttle.,- You can't hold the police,harmless in this case,because,there are,officers that have the same,laser scanners that we have,that are accident reconstructionists.,We've had several cases,at Knott Laboratory,where we take the police data,and we use it the way it should be used,,with videogrammetry.,And I don't think that in this case,,you just let somebody off the hook,'cause you're not technically,able to analyze the data,that you could collect.,So, I don't think there was,enough investigation done,on their part.,I don't think that, a lot of times,,that they put forth,the effort they need to,for justice to be served.,A great question would be,,to that grand jury would be,,show 'em the paths that the vehicles took.,There's six cars that passed Kevin Ward,without impacting him.,Show 'em the path that Tony Stewart took,prior to the accident,,and see if that would change their opinion,of whether there was any intent,,or any harmful intent in this case,,that would've changed their opinion,that a crime was committed.,- Do you think that if,a grand jury or the DA,would independently look,at that information,,that it might have made a,different determination that day?,- Oh my God, yes.,I think that would be.,- I would sure hope that would.,- It's beyond me that we can have,a tape forensically,analyzed out in Albany,,and that tape was the one that they used,to supposedly clear Tony,,to clear Tony without any,wrongdoing whatsoever.,But yet, in our case, we,have it forensically analyzed,and it's completely the opposite.,So, like, how does that happen?,- Oh, there's definitely wounds, you know.,And I think even what was kind of weird,is the perception of the whole thing,started out one direction,,and then just kind of completely flipped,the other direction.,I think at first, it was hands,down it was Tony's fault.,And then,,as the whole investigation,started going on,,everything was kind of like,moving towards the other direction.,And at the end of it, I think 100%,,it was completely Kevin Ward's fault.,And I don't think the,original was the right way,and I don't think the,end was the right way.,There's a lot of gray here.,- Like we wanted him held accountable.,And you know, if you do kill somebody,,even if it wasn't intent,,like he didn't intentionally,mean to kill my brother.,I also do not believe that.,But he did.,His actions that he had that night,did cause his death.,And even if it does,take another five years,,I want his story out there,,the truth of what really,happened that day.,(poignant piano music),(piano music continues),(dog barking),- What I admired most about him,is,his zest for life.,He was such a happy person.,He was just one of those happy-go-lucky,,like roll-with-anything,kind of personal attitudes.,Like, he just took advantage of life.,(solemn piano music),He enjoyed his life, the,short time that he had.,And I miss his smile.,I miss the happiness he,always gave to other people.,He'll be missed forever, for sure.,(solemn piano music),(solemn piano music continues),(solemn piano music continues),(gritty rock
